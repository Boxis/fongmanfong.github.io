## TL;DR

Hey, nice to meet you! My name is **Jason Fong** and I am a Data Scientist focused on solving marketing problems. I am currently working at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and I'm leading the Marketing Data Science team. 

My job is pretty straightforward: help marketing make more data informed decisions to reduce cost of acquisition and increase revenue for Shopify. How do I do this with my team? Well that is not so straightforward. We're working on things like:

* Building and productionizing an algorithmic attribution model
* Media Mix Modelling to complement multi-touch attribution model
* Geo Experimentation to understand causal impact of marketing campaigns
* Building a state-of-the-art data infrastructure with scalable data pipelines to produce high quality datasets
* Statistical Modelling & Machine Learning (churn, LTV, propensity, lead scoring etc)
* A/B testing and experiments
* Causal inference and regression modelling to understand what levers move the needle

Marketing is a complex domain and I'm just scratching the surface. If you're also solving marketing problems with data science, please reach out, I would love to connect and exchange knowledge. I'm also hiring, please reach out if you would like to learn more about the work I'm doing at Shopify. Add me on LinkedIn, follow me on Instagram or Twitter, or even better lets get COFFEE (if you're in Toronto).
